    "## Using the fine-tuned classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The fine-tuned model can be used to classify child-directed websites using the code below. You can either fine-tune your own model following the instructions in the [fine-tuning.ipynb](https://github.com/targeted-and-troublesome/targeted-and-troublesome-crawler/blob/main/classifier/fine-tuning.ipynb) notebook, or download the fine-tuned model [here](TODO).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what each step involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading the Model and Tokenizer**:\n",
    "   - **Model**: The fine-tuned model is loaded from its saved directory.\n",
    "   - **Tokenizer**: The tokenizer that was used during the training phase is also loaded. The tokenizer converts text data into a format that the model can understand (i.e., tokenized tensors).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating a Classification Pipeline**:\n",
    "   - A pipeline is created using the `pipeline` function from the `transformers` library. This pipeline encapsulates the model and tokenizer into a single object which simplifies the process of making predictions.\n",
    "   - The pipeline is set up specifically for text classification and is configured to run on a specific device (e.g., GPU or CPU). This setup includes options such as enabling truncation to handle text that exceeds the model's maximum input length.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Running Predictions on Sample Text Data**:\n",
    "   - With the pipeline ready, you can input sample text data to get predictions. The pipeline outputs the predicted class labels along with confidence scores. In the paper, the confidence scores were used to prioritize most-likely child-directed websites for manual labeling.\n"
